#  My First Few Web Development Experiments

###  Context
This repository contains the very first lines of HTML and CSS I ever wrote. 

While these pages are rudimentary and simplistic compared to my current skill set, I have chosen to keep this repository public as a **"Time Capsule."** It serves as a benchmark to demonstrate my growth as a developer.

###  What I Learned Here
At the time of creating this, I was learning the absolute basics:
* Understanding HTML DOM structure.
* Linking multiple pages together (`<a href>`).
* Basic CSS styling and layout.

###  My Evolution
To see how my skills have evolved from these early days to building full-stack applications with database integration and modern frameworks, please check out my recent work:

* **[Ozone Fitness Management System](https://github.com/Satvik0007/Ozone-Fitness-Management)** (Full Stack PHP/MySQL Project)
* **[Automated Attendance System](https://github.com/Satvik0007/[Your-Repo-Name])** (Python/OpenCV Project)
